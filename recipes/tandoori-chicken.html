<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Tandoori Chicken, a beloved classic in Indian cuisine, captivates with its
  bold flavors and succulent texture. This iconic dish begins with tender
  chicken pieces, traditionally marinated in a vibrant blend of yogurt, lemon
  juice, and an array of aromatic spices. The marinade, infused with ingredients
  like cumin, coriander, paprika, and garam masala, imparts layers of flavor
  while tenderizing the meat, ensuring each bite is an explosion of taste.
</p>
<p>
  To achieve its signature smoky flavor and charred exterior, the marinated
  chicken is traditionally cooked in a tandoor, a clay oven that reaches
  scorching temperatures. As the chicken roasts in the intense heat, the
  marinade caramelizes, forming a tantalizing crust while sealing in the
  chicken's natural juices. The result is a masterpiece of culinary
  craftsmanship – juicy, tender chicken with a slightly crispy exterior, imbued
  with the smoky aroma of the tandoor and the nuanced spice of the marinade.
  Tandoori Chicken isn't just a dish; it's a sensory experience that transports
  diners to the bustling streets of India, where the tantalizing aroma of spices
  and sizzling meats fills the air, inviting them to indulge in the rich
  tapestry of flavors that define Indian cuisine.

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place
    into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt.
    Let sit for 20 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together
    in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours
    (the longer the better).
  </li>
  <li>
    When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and

    Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run
    clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165
    degrees F (74 degrees C).
