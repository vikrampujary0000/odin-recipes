<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Palak Paneer, a quintessential dish in Indian cuisine, tantalizes taste buds
  with its rich blend of flavors and textures. This vibrant vegetarian delicacy
  combines two key ingredients: 'palak,' or spinach, and 'paneer,' a soft, fresh
  cheese. The recipe begins with the meticulous preparation of the spinach,
  which is blanched to retain its vivid green hue before being pureed into a
  velvety, aromatic base. Fragrant spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam
  masala are then gently sautéed to release their essence, infusing the dish
  with layers of warmth and depth.

<p>
  Cubes of paneer, lightly fried to achieve a delicate golden exterior, are
  added to the simmering spinach, soaking up the flavorful sauce while
  maintaining their tender interior. The result is a harmony of flavors – the
  earthiness of spinach complementing the creamy richness of paneer, punctuated
  by the subtle heat of spices. Palak Paneer is not just a dish; it's a
  celebration of culinary finesse, inviting diners to savor every spoonful and
  embrace the symphony of tastes that define Indian cuisine.

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add spinach and cook for 1 minute.
    Transfer to a bowl of ice water to keep spinach bright green.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds to hot
    oil so they sizzle. Add onion, chile, garlic, and ginger. Cook until onion
    is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until soft, about 2
    minutes more. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool.
  </li>

    Transfer tomato mixture to a blender; add blanched spinach. Blend to a
    thick, smooth paste; thin with a few teaspoons water if needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat remaining oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add coriander, cumin,
    chile powder, and turmeric. Fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add spinach
    paste and cook over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add water and cook for 5
    minutes more. Season gravy with salt.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add paneer to the gravy and mix well to coat. Cook 5 minutes more. Add garam
    masala and cream. Stir and cook over low heat for 2 minutes. Garnish with
    chile flakes.
