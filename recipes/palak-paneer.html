        Palak Paneer, a quintessential dish in Indian cuisine, tantalizes taste buds
        with its rich blend of flavors and textures. This vibrant vegetarian delicacy
        combines two key ingredients: 'palak,' or spinach, and 'paneer,' a soft, fresh
        cheese. The recipe begins with the meticulous preparation of the spinach,
        which is blanched to retain its vivid green hue before being pureed into a
        velvety, aromatic base. Fragrant spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam
        masala are then gently sautéed to release their essence, infusing the dish
        with layers of warmth and depth.

        Cubes of paneer, lightly fried to achieve a delicate golden exterior, are
        added to the simmering spinach, soaking up the flavorful sauce while
        maintaining their tender interior. The result is a harmony of flavors – the
        earthiness of spinach complementing the creamy richness of paneer, punctuated
        by the subtle heat of spices. Palak Paneer is not just a dish; it's a
        celebration of culinary finesse, inviting diners to savor every spoonful and
        embrace the symphony of tastes that define Indian cuisine.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add spinach and cook for 1 minute.
          Transfer to a bowl of ice water to keep spinach bright green.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds to hot
          oil so they sizzle. Add onion, chile, garlic, and ginger. Cook until onion
          is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until soft, about 2
          minutes more. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer tomato mixture to a blender; add blanched spinach. Blend to a
          thick, smooth paste; thin with a few teaspoons water if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat remaining oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add coriander, cumin,
          chile powder, and turmeric. Fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add spinach
          paste and cook over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add water and cook for 5
          minutes more. Season gravy with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add paneer to the gravy and mix well to coat. Cook 5 minutes more. Add garam
          masala and cream. Stir and cook over low heat for 2 minutes. Garnish with
          chile flakes.
